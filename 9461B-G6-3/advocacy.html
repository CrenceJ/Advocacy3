					<p>There are serious consequences when a person becomes abusive of these substances such as lung or heart disease, stroke, cancer or mental health conditions. Many people don’t understand why others become addicted to alcohol, smoking and drugs. They mistakenly 
					think that those who drink or smoke lack moral principle or the willpower to stop their addiction. It is not simple to put an end to this bad habits, in reality, it really takes more than just good intentions and a strong will to stop one’s addiction.
					</p>
					<p>As a student, there are things we can do to avoid drugs and alcohol abuse. By sharing these simple tips, you can save your loved ones, and you, yourself.</p>
					<li>Deal with stress effectively
						<ul class="prov">
							<li>One of the common reason why students use drug or drink alcohol is because of the pressure they encounter whenever they are obliged to do the school requirements. They want to somewhat forget the cause of their stress and feel free. Some situation 
							involves the parent’s high expectations to their children. Find other ways to deal with these pressure such as reading books, chatting with friends over a cup of coffee or tea, or even play sports in order to release the stress you have been feeling.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Seek help
						<ul class="prov">
							<li>You are not alone in this world. Don’t be afraid to ask someone that might help you solve your problems. Drugs, alcohols, and other addictive substances might help you forget them for a short period of time, but you can’t run away. Instead of wasting 
							your time, use this chance to deal with the problems bothering you and make your life work out.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Keep a well-balanced life
						<ul class="prov">
							<li>If you think you can’t do it anymore, you’re wrong. Critical thinking is very important to someone who doesn’t know what to do anymore with their life and just wasting time in using drugs or alcohols. Know your priorities and start to figure out what has
							to be done. Don’t think of solving all your problems at once. Try to unfold the causes of the problems one by one until you arrive to a better solution.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Figure out the problem
						<ul class="prov">
							<li>You cannot solve the problem if you don’t know the root of it. Find out what happened and what are the causes of these stress so you can create a better plan on solving it. Learn your lessons and apply it to your life for a better future.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
